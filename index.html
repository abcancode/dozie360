      <h2 class="about_header">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text_about">
        Born and raised in Osun State, I am the first child in a family of five,
        a unique position that has shaped my sense of responsibility and
        leadership. My heritage is a rich blend of cultures, as I am the son of
        an Igbo father and a Yoruba mother. Growing up in this culturally
        diverse environment taught me the importance of unity, adaptability, and
        embracing different perspectives. I take pride in my ability to
        communicate fluently in English, Yoruba, and Igbo, a skill that allows
        me to connect with people from various backgrounds seamlessly. In
        pursuit of my passion for technology, I studied Computer Science at the
        University of Nigeria, where I graduated in 2018. During my time at the
        university, I developed a deep love for working with computers and
        exploring how they can solve real-world problems. My academic journey
        equipped me with the technical skills and problem-solving mindset needed
        to thrive in the tech industry. Beyond academics, my love for sports,
        particularly basketball, has played a significant role in shaping my
        discipline and teamwork skills, which I apply in both my personal and
        professional life. I am a Software Engineer and Cloud Engineering
        enthusiast. A fervent Chelsea FC supporter, I find joy and inspiration
        in the beautiful game of football, which teaches resilience, strategy,
        and the value of collaboration. My passion for sports complements my
        technical pursuits, creating a balanced lifestyle that keeps me
        motivated and focused on my goals. With a deep appreciation for my roots
        and an unwavering drive to excel, I aim to contribute meaningfully to my
        community and beyond through technology and innovation.

        AgroMind: AI-Powered Precision Farming Assistant
      </h2>
      <p class="text_startup">
        AgroMind is an AI-powered precision farming platform designed to help
        farmers make smarter, data-driven decisions for crop cultivation and
        resource management. It integrates real-time satellite imagery, IoT
        sensors, drone surveillance, and AI analytics to monitor soil
        conditions, detect pests and diseases, and recommend optimal irrigation,
        fertilization, and harvesting schedules. With support for voice commands
        in local languages and predictive insights based on weather and crop
        patterns, AgroMind acts as a digital farming assistant tailored to both
        smallholder and large-scale farmers. The platform aims to increase
        yields, reduce waste, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
      </p>
      <h3>Why AgroMind Is Innovative</h3>
      <p class="text_startup_second">
        It combines AI, IoT, and computer vision to provide farmers with
        precise, real-time recommendations instead of relying on guesswork. Its
        voice-enabled assistant breaks literacy and language barriers, giving
        smallholder farmers easy access to expert-level guidance. By leveraging
        drone and satellite data, AgroMind brings high-tech tools traditionally
        reserved for large agribusinesses to everyday farmers in emerging
        markets.
